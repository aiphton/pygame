# Transporter Game

  

### This game was made for a school project, but got way out of hand and got bigger than anticipated.

The of my game is to deliver 80 ores to the designated area. There will be a helicopter chasing you around the map. 
If the helicopter achieves to steal 20 ores from you, you will lose the game. Oh, and you will also lose if you run out of fuel. \
This short game was made with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

## Usage
To play the game, you have to have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [pygame library](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. \
Once you have it installed, you should be able to start the game with `python main.py` (on Windows at least).
